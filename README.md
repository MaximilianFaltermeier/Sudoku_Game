# Sudoku_Game

Wellcome to be Sudoku game. This is an example project to see my coding style. Here is a short description what is can do:

This programm loads in a sudoku (stored as a .txt) and displays it. I use tKinter for the GUI. The game can be played like any ordinary sudoku game.
Fill in numbers, delete numbers etc. The game can show you all possibilities. The programm generates a sample solution by itself with a selfdeveloped
efficient algorithm. It can also suggest solutions/hints. This uses a different algorithm! This programm is supposed to give hints according to how a human would
find the next number. This part is still in progress.

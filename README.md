# Sudoku_Game

Welcome to my Sudoku game. This is an example project to see my coding style. Here is a short description about what is can do:

This program loads in a sudoku (stored as a .txt) and displays it. I use tKinter for the GUI. The game can be played like any ordinary sudoku game.
Fill in numbers, delete numbers etc. The game can show you all possibilities. The program generates a sample solution by itself with a self-developed
efficient algorithm. It can also suggest solutions/hints. This uses a different algorithm! This programm is supposed to give hints according to how a human would
find the next number. This part is still in progress. 

# way of working

I have three coding principles:

1. a code is supposed to be readable without comments like an 'ordinary text'.
2. test-driven-development. This means that test functions are written before the actual function is implemented
3. If a new function is introduced, the code will be just changed as minimal as possible. This also means that changes only refer to the next step/function. There are no preparations for future functions. Why? This keeps code simple. Most future plans will be changed anyway. (compare sprint in scrum guideline)
